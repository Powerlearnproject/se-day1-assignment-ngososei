Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing a system or software to solve everyday problems. 
It is important for automating processes by developing software’s /systems that would require a lot of resources if done manually.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages, rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s and establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- involves identifying the needs of the user and what is required of the system functionality,
Design- this is the design of the system architecture and the user interface
Implementation – is the writing of code and building the system according to the design specifications
Testing – to ensure the system meets the user functional requirement and meets the quality standards of the software 
Deployment – roll out of the system for user interaction
Maintenance – involves ongoing support including customizations to meet user needs that come up after deployment or new regulations and policies. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is a flexible form of project management where it allows for changes to be done as the project is ongoing, its iterative and incremental approach is ideal for projects that can be implemented in phases. Unlike Agile, waterfall approach follows the design from the inception it follows a linear flow of process making it a rigid approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- involved in the writing of the code and implementation of the system as per user needs document.
Quality Assurance Engineer- checks and verify software quality by designing and executing test plans,
Project Manager – Manages the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
This programs designed to provide tools for writing, testing, and debugging codes as well as tracking changes of source codes ensures programmers enhanced productivity, Collaboration and code Quality. Examples include Git for open source, Vision studio and eclipse.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirement changes- requirement can involve a lot of customization and changes as the project is ongoing which may lead to delay in deployment timelines of the project, this can be avoided by implementing the project in phases, this allows the user to interact with the system and figure out what they might want to be changed to suite their requirement better.
Short timelines/Deadlines- users with tight timelines gives pressure to developers and it turn may compromise on the quality of the system. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Quality assurance ensures the system meets specified quality standards and functional requirement stipulated.
Unit Testing- involves testing of individual components of the software,
Integration Testing- is the testing of interaction on different components of subsystems.
Acceptance-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering involves using word or terms to get specific response as per user requires 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is the Impact of digital banking in Kenya? - this would give a general overview of all forms of digital banking.
What is the impact of Agency Banking in Kenya? This would give specific data on Agency Banking as a form of Digital banking solution in Kenya.
